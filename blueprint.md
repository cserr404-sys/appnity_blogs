# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and development plan for a modern, premium Next.js application. The goal is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive web application with a focus on a high-quality user experience.

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15
*   **UI Library:** React 19
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion
*   **Icons:** Lucide Icons
*   **Notifications:** Sonner

## Implemented Features

### Styling and Design

*   **Typography:** Expressive and relevant typography will be used to enhance readability and user understanding.
*   **Color Palette:** A premium neutral color palette will be used to create a modern, "Medium-like" look and feel.
*   **Visual Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows will be used to create a sense of depth and lift interactive elements.
*   **Iconography:** Modern icons from Lucide will be used to improve navigation and user understanding.
*   **Interactivity:** Interactive elements will have a "glow" effect to provide visual feedback.

### Core Components

*   **Sidebar:** A collapsible navigation sidebar with links to all major sections of the application, a theme toggle, and social media links. The sidebar will be animated with Framer Motion.
*   **Top Navbar:** A top navbar with a search bar, user avatar, and notification bell.
*   **Theme Toggle:** A theme toggle will allow users to switch between light and dark modes.
*   **Toast Notifications:** Toast notifications will be used to provide feedback for all user actions.

## Development History

### Initial Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Installed `framer-motion` and `sonner`.
2.  **Update `tailwind.config.ts`:** Configured the Tailwind CSS theme with the new color palette.
3.  **Create `ThemeProvider`:** Created a new component to manage the application's theme.
4.  **Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:** Wrapped the application in the `ThemeProvider` and added the `Toaster` component.
5.  **Update `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`:** Updated the sidebar with the new links, animations, and theme toggle.
6.  **Create `Header` Component:** Created the top navbar component.
7.  **Update `src/app/page.tsx`:** Added the `Header` component to the main page.
8.  **Lint and Format:** Ran `npm run lint -- --fix` to ensure code quality.

### Error Resolutions

*   **`CssSyntaxError`:** Fixed an error in `src/app/globals.css` caused by outdated Tailwind CSS syntax. Replaced the incorrect directives with the correct `@theme` syntax for defining the color palette.
*   **`Module not found: Can't resolve 'geist/font/sans'`:** Resolved an error by installing the `geist` package and updating the `src/app/layout.tsx` file to remove the specific font import, falling back to system fonts.
*   **Hydration Error:** Fixed a hydration mismatch error by ensuring the theme toggle icon in the `Sidebar` component is only rendered on the client-side, preventing a mismatch between the server and client-rendered HTML.
